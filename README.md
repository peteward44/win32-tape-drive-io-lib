# Archived
I wrote this code 15 years ago; i found it and put it on github to see if anyone else might find some use of out it. There seem to be several issues with it which some people have found - see the issues section for more info. I don't have the time or hardware to investigate these, but if you wish you can fork this project and have a go yourself. This library itself is pretty small though and should be simple enough to understand; best of luck!
